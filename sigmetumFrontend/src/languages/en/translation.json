This group of teachers is complemented by PhD students, who will be in charge of constantly testing the proper functioning of the software, and supported by business entities from the environmental sector, involved in applying the information in their daily activities.",
    "projectPurposeSubtitle": "Project purpose",
    "projectPurposeContent": "This Educational Innovation Project, promoted by the University of Malaga, aims to facilitate the teaching-learning of Andalusian Geobotany in any discipline related to the Environment, as well as to provide a practical tool for the application of this science in restoration projects, recovery and conservation of plant diversity.",
    "ourMissionSubtitle": "Our mission",
    "ourMissionContent": "Given the transversality of the work team, with SIGMETUM-A we aim to facilitate the study of vegetation at higher education level, as well as to facilitate the work of environmental professionals at different scales, by means of a tool that brings together all the environmental information necessary for a global vision of vegetation.",
    "ourValuesSubtitle": "Our values",
    "ourValuesContent": "At SIGMETUM-A our main motivation is to train future professionals in environmental management, ecosystem restoration and vegetation conservation, through, firstly, a complete learning of geobotany and knowledge of vegetation and, subsequently, a correct application of the skills acquired, generating a comprehensive vision and critical thinking when resolving conflicts in the natural environment."
